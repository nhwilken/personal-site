# Neale's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, showcasing some of my web development skills as well as being a prototyping platform for some of my long shelved project ideas. The site was made using django as the server side framwork, with bootstrap as a frontend framework.

## Features

So far there is only one app::

- Recipe Lab - a web app for help keep track of recipes as they develop by logging recipe changes and allowing some level of history as recipes evolve.
