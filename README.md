# Neale's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, showcasing some of my web development skills as well as being a prototyping platform for some of my long shelved project idea for web based apps. The site was made using django as the sever site framwork, with bootstrap as a framework for the front end

## Features

So far there is only one app shown::

- Recipe Lab - a web app for help keep track of recipes as they develop by logging recipe changes and allowing some level or analysis of the results and direction of a recipe
